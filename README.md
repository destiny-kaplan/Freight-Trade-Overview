Freight Trade Overview: Modes, Markets, and Economic Impact (2018–2024)

This project leverages the US Department of Transportation’s Freight Analysis Framework (FAF5) to examine how goods move across the U.S. and internationally from 2018 to 2024. Using cleaned and enriched data, I built an interactive Tableau dashboard that shows freight modes, trade flows, revenues, and geographic patterns. The goal was to identify which modes dominate trade, how revenues have changed over time, and which states act as key trade hubs.
